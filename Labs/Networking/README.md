# 🌐 Networking Labs Overview

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of the **Networking** section is to build a strong foundation in computer networking — understanding how data travels, how networks are structured, and how to configure and troubleshoot them using real-world tools and commands.

## 📘 Learning Objectives
By completing these labs, I aim to:
- Understand the **OSI and TCP/IP models** and how different layers interact.
- Learn how to configure **IP addressing, subnets, routing, and DNS**.
- Use **Linux networking commands** to test and manage connectivity.
- Understand how **virtual networks** connect in the **cloud and on-prem environments**.

---

## 🧩 Labs Included
- **Basic Networking Commands** — Practicing `ping`, `traceroute`, `ifconfig`, `ip`, `netstat`, and `nslookup`.
- **Subnetting & IP Addressing** — Understanding CIDR notation, subnet masks, and address allocation.
- **Azure Networking Lab** — Creating VNets and subnets in Azure to simulate real-world cloud networking.
